# What is a Module?
# Consider a module to be the same as a code library or collection of functions.
# A file containing a set of functions you want to include in your application.
# You can create a module and import it, instead of copying the code into your program.
import cal as calculator
# c.add(10, 20) 
# using calculator as alias for cal
# calling add function from cal module
calculator
# <module 'cal' from 'C:\\Users\\HP\\Desktop\\Python\\Day-04\\cal.py'>
